      <p> About Boredom: This game puts you in the place of a student in summer break. Nothing to do, no one to see. In your desperation for anything to hold your attention, you get transported to a strange world. What happens next is up to you. </p>
      
      <p> About Sadness: After a hard day, you get back to your apartment. You do simple tasks that will improve your mood, and maybe get a friend along the way.  </p>
      
      <p> About Happiness:
        You spend a beautiful day in nature, and quite literally lose yourself.... and your car </p>
      
      <p> About Anger: Having parents who basically control your life is hell. When they do something horrible, you are taken on a journey where you will be tested. </p>
